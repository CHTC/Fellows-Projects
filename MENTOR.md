# Repository Preparation/Use

## Before Fellowship Start (Mentors/Maintainers of repo)

1. Create new subdirectory named with the year of the fellowship under
   *projects/*.
2. Copy *projects/TEMPLATE.md* into newly create year subdirectory as
   *README.md*and update accordingly with planned fellow & project
   information.
3. Create new subdirectory named with all fellows working on the project
   under *projects/<year>/*.

## Fellowship Start (Fellows)

1. Have fellows fork repository.
2. Have fellows make pull request updating the following:
   1. Create *README.md* in specific fellow directory containing
      the project proposal, design, details, and reasoning.
   2. (Optional) Update the current years *README.md* with
      any personal information/links they desire.

## Use of Repository (Fellows)

1. Develop and store project code in specific fellow directory
   if stand alone.
2. Store any testing code in specific fellow directory. Preferably
   execute a github action to run tests.
3. Store any project specific documenation in specific fellow
   directory in Markdown.

## Fellowship End (Mentors/Maintainers of repo)

1. Update the year *README.md* to link the final report for each
