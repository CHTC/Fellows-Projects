# CHTC Summer Fellowship Projects

### Welcome!

This repository contains the projects developed by participants
of the [CHTC Fellowship Program](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/)
since 2026. All projects can be found under *projects/* organized
by year and then fellow name. While majority of the fellows project
code is stand alone and stored in this repository, some projects
may contribute code (entirely or partially) to production code
maintained and developed by the CHTC such as [HTCondor](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor)
or [Pelican](https://github.com/pelicanplatform/pelican).

The outcome of all fellowship projects can be seen in the
[final project reports](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/fellows).
